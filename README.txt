This repository contains the Eagle files you can use to manipulate the circuit board
or create gerber files to have your board made by a professional board house. However, 
I recommended using this repository for making the board at home.

For your convenience, I have already created a pdf file of the board that you can use
to print out and use the 'iron-on' method for creating your own single-sided board:
GarageDoorController-v10.pdf

When assembling your board, I have provided an additional pdf for your reference:
GarageDoorController-v10AssemblyReference.pdf


If you want to send gerber files off to a board house, I highly recommend using my 
other repository:

For more information and instructions on how to set all of this up and how everything works
together, please visit the home page of the project on my website:
